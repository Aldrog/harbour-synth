# ViPiano
A synthesizer / virtual piano keyboard built on top of FluidSynth for Sailfish OS.

Currently at the early stage of development.

## TODO
- [x] Make FluidSynth compile with Sailfish SDK
- [x] Build a basic UI connected to FluidSynth
- [ ] Reduce package size (ATM ViPiano uses high-quality uncompressed 142 MB sound font)
- [ ] Enhance UI. Make keys more recognizible, better handling of finger movements, improve layout.
